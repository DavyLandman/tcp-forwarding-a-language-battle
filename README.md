# TCP Tunneling: a language battle

This repository contains the implementations of the same program in different languages/frameworks. The goal is simple: programming fun. I found this simple "problem" and it has some complications making it just difficult enough to hit the rougher edges of a language (or framework).

## The "problem"
### Context
Forwarding the port `443` to your ssh server is a very good way of making sure you can [escape most hotel/airport/company versions of internet](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1aok5j/does_everyone_use_ssh_over_port_443_to_bypass/).

However, I was already using port `443` to host some personal HTTPS sites.
Not wanting to loose those, I required a special kind of port forwarding: based on the first packet it would have to redirect everything to either the ssh server or the https server. Much later I found out that [sslh](http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml) does exactly this. But that was after my programmer mind was triggered. So I wrote the first version of the program in a few lines of nodejs, and the program slowly evolved.
