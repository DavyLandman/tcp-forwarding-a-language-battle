# TCP Tunneling: a language battle

This repository contains the implementations of the same program in different languages/frameworks. The goal is simple: programming fun. I found this simple "problem" and it has some complications making it just difficult enough to hit the rougher edges of a language (or framework).

## The "problem"
Forwarding the port `443` to your ssh server is a very good way of making sure you can escape most hotel/airport/company versions of internet.
However, I was already using port `443` to host some personal HTTPS sites.
Not wanting to lose those, I special kind of port forwarding, based on the first packet it would have to redirect everything to either the ssh server or the https server. ( Only later did I find that this is exactly what [sslh](http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml) does)
